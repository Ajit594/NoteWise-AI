## üöÄ The Problem

Students are often overwhelmed with dense lecture notes, textbooks, and articles. The process of manually summarizing content, creating flashcards, and writing practice questions is tedious, time-consuming, and can be a barrier to effective learning.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

NoteWise AI streamlines the entire study process. Simply paste your notes or upload a document (PDF, DOCX, TXT), and our AI will instantly generate:

*   **üéØ Key Points Summary:** A concise, bulleted list of the most important information.
*   **üñºÔ∏è Interactive Flashcards:** Beautifully designed flashcards with questions, answers, and **AI-generated images** to create strong visual associations.
*   **‚úçÔ∏è Challenging Quizzes:** A multiple-choice quiz to test your knowledge and help you identify areas for improvement.

This allows students to create high-quality, personalized study aids in seconds, not hours.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

NoteWise AI is built with a modern, scalable, and powerful tech stack:

*   **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) & [React](https://react.dev/)
*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
*   **Generative AI:** [Google's Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) & Gemini Models

We used **Google's Genkit** to orchestrate multiple calls to the Gemini AI model, enabling us to generate structured JSON for summaries, flashcards, and quizzes in a single, efficient server action. This includes advanced features like extracting text from documents and generating relevant image queries for the flashcards.

## üèÜ Why NoteWise AI Stands Out

*   **Efficiency:** Drastically reduces the time and effort required to create study materials.
*   **Enhanced Learning:** Visual aids on flashcards and instant quiz feedback improve retention and understanding.
*   **Accessibility:** Supports both text input and common document formats (PDF, DOCX), making it versatile for any type of note-taker.
*   **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and intuitive interface that makes studying a pleasure, not a chore.
